as well as approximately 100 interviews with X PRIZE Foundation advisors. 
These preliminary guidelines are open for public review and comment until 
June 30, 2012. Final competition guidelines for the Qualcomm Tricorder X 
PRIZE will be made available in approximately September 2012.

    * Can a team member be exempt from the release if required?
<br />
